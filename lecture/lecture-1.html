# A Data Science Project

1. Background
  - A business question that needs to be addressed for a value
  
2. Data Collection
  - The business question is translated to data requirements  
  - Once the requirements are clear, we need to collect the data  

3. The Resuls
  - We create a model based on the data product from 2  
  - Once model is validated, we create a report

4. In Production
  - If the customer accepts finding from 3, we put our model into production

# How this class works

* Basic understanding of programming  
  - We will cover advanced methods in R and data science
  - You need to understand data structures, coding, and creating scripts
* Some stats knowledge presumed
  - We Will cover some advanced methods in data science which require understanding of Statistics
* Class attendance is mandatory  
  1. If you miss a class, you will miss the explanation of a lab 
  2. you'll miss some information for homework
  3. you'll miss some information for the final project
* Collaboration is expected  
  - Data Science does not happen in a vaccum, we do a lot of team collaboration
* Class will be very cumulative  
  - See class attendance

# Class Structure - Less talk, more doing

# Grading Structure

* Class participation (15%)  

* Lab Work (15%)

* Assignments (20%)  

* Final project (50%)  

Disclaimer: Lab work and class participation can be adjusted at instructer's discretion. While late homeworks will not be accepted for grades, I highly encourage you to complete them and turn them in.

# More about grading

Class participation/Labs (30%)  

* Labs: Each lecture has an accompanying lab assignment that is due next day by 6pm.
* The completion of labs is needed to finish your homework

Homework assignments (20%)

* Homework: There will be four homework assignment that builds on top of your in-class labs.  
    * Each homework also builds on top of the other homeworks.
* Single lowest HW score will be dropped
* HW assigned are due following week at start of class
* Late homework will not be accepted for credit

Final project (50%)

* Final Project: Instead of a final test, we will have a final project that will be in the form of a complete report that will be the accumulation of all the labs and homeworks. I encourage you to find a topic early on as to avoid last minute problems.

# Course resources

Required textbook: [Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, R for Data Science](r4ds.had.co.nz)  

### Other resources
  
[Hadley Wickham, ggplot2](ggplot2.org)  
[RStudio Webinars](webinars.rstudio.com)  
[RMarkdown official website](rmarkdown.rstudio.com)

We will be very collaborative and I will insist on version control, thus, each student is required to create a [free GitHub account](github.com)

---

# Goal of this class  

This class will teach you to use R, the integerated development environment (IDE) RStudio and version control and collaboration through GitHub to:  
  
1. Create scripts and use version control  
2. Generate graphical and tabular data summaries  
3. Perform data science analytics: Data Wrangling, Data Visualization, and Data Modeling  
4. Produce reproducible statistical reports using R Markdown  
5. Integrate R with other tools (e.g., databases, web, etc.)  

---

# Why R?  

* I like it 
* Free (open-source)  
* Programming language (not point-and-click)  
* Excellent graphics  
* Offers broadest range of statistical tools  
* Easy to generate reproducible reports  
* Easy to integrate with databases without the need to learn another language

# Understanding data science problems

__there are multiple approaches to solve a problem and all of them lead to the same solution, but chosing the right one for your data at hand is key__ 

---

# Some pointers on coding in general

* Don't reinvent the wheel  
* If you have a problem, ask for help  
* Most problems you have, someone else had it before you  
* Write your code in a way that you can look at it in a year and know what you were doing  
* [Create a StackOverflow account, look for help and in return, try to help](stackoverflow.com)  
* Use functional programming
